Governed by the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act, bankruptcy is a formal process whereby debtors who cannot meet their obligations sign over all of their assets—except those exempt by law—to a Licensed Insolvency Trustee (LIT). The LIT's role includes selling off those assets to satisfy outstanding debts. Once debtors are formally declared bankrupt, lawsuits by creditor are stayed and garnishments against debtors' salaries stop.

Here, My effort to see the analysis through geographical plots, bar chart, histogram plots and also with the heat map or correlation map, stackover flow for the bankruptcies situation in Canada.
from all this charts and plots can found average bankrutcies is 18810.077 and from the gender and age group dashboard I found that most of the bankrutcies having at the age of 45-49years old people.
